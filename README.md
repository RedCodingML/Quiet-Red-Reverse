Quiet-red-reverse
------------
A modification of quiet-purple. 
This theme is in Red-Alert'ish red where active is brighter than inactive.

Original readme file follows :
A port of quiet-purple theme for metacity with redesigned buttons.

This theme is my first one, without counting keramik-Gyellow that was only an 
edited version of the keramik theme. My target was to have a smooth and 
"eye-relaxing" theme that was intuitive to use and also a bit original. 
So I've used prelight for unfocused buttons (try to move the mouse over 
buttons of a unfocused window), I've designed the restore (from maximized 
state) button as a toggle button and I've not put the maximize, minimize 
and close symbols over the unfocused buttons.
